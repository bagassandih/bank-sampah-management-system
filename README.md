# Bank Sampah Management System

Bank Sampah Management System is a project inspired by a real-world case in my village where traditional or manual methods are still being used. 

These methods include recording data on paper, manual calculations, and traditional analysis by checking each item one by one. 

This has become a burden on the management of the waste bank activities. Therefore, I created this management system.
